# **Retail Store Customer Segmentation**

This project aims to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using a K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing purchase patterns, we can identify distinct customer segments, which can help in tailoring marketing strategies, improving customer service, and enhancing product offerings.


**The project includes two main components**:

App.py: A Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the clustering model, visualize the clusters, and explore customer segments. The app provides an easy-to-use interface to understand the results of the K-Means clustering.
Prodigy_ML_02.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and clustering code. This notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of the K-Means algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase history.

By using this application, retail store managers and analysts can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and make data-driven decisions to enhance business operations.
